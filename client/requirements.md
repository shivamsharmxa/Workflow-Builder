## Packages
reactflow | The core library for the node-based editor canvas
zustand | State management for the complex editor state (nodes, edges, selection)
@radix-ui/react-slider | For sliders in the properties panel (duration, etc.)
@radix-ui/react-switch | For toggle switches in properties
lucide-react | Icon set (already in base, but confirming usage)

## Notes
The app uses a dark theme exclusively (#000000 background).
Mock run simulation logic will be handled in the frontend store for this prototype phase.
ReactFlow styling requires importing 'reactflow/dist/style.css'.
